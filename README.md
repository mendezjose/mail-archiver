## Introduction

This project is an imaginary admin console for a system which archives emails of an organization and it's used to retrieve and verify the emails.

The project was created using HTML CSS and Javascript (React).

## Setup

Make sure to follow all these steps exactly as explained below. Do not miss any steps or you won't be able to run this application.

### Install the Dependencies

Next, from the project folder, install the dependencies:

    npm i

### Start the App

    npm start

This will launch the App on port 3000. If that port is busy, you can set a different point in config/default.json.

Open up your browser and head over to:

http://localhost:3000

You should see the list of emails. That confirms that you have set up everything successfully.
